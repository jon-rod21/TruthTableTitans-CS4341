Parts List:

Dec4x16:
    decodes a 4 bit opcode to a 16 bit onehot number for selection

Mux16x8: 
    selects 1 of 16 input signals and forwards it to one of 8 output lines 

FourBitMul   
    behaviouraly multiplies 2 4 bit numbers

FourBitAddSub
    uses the full adder with 2 4 bit numbers and a carry signal to determine addition or subtraction within the full adder

FourBitDiv   
    Uses behavioral division to divide 2 inputs A and B while erroring if division is by 0

FourBitMod   
    Uses behavioral modulus to mod 2 inputs A and B, erroring if modding by 0

FourBitBuffer
